## Project
GradTracker is a text and web application that helps educators keep up with former students activities after graduation, specifically focused on further education and employment status after graduation. By saving this information it gives educators the ability to look at trends over time amongst their graduate pool. Using Twilio will give educators a way to keep in touch with graduates whom don't (or don't frequently) check their emails.
